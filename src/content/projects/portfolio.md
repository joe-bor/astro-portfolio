#### Background/Description

**Context**: As we approach the culmination of our software engineering bootcamp, the formidable challenge of embarking on the job hunt looms before us, especially for those transitioning into this field. In today's competitive job market, the primary hurdle is capturing the attention of prospective employers amidst a sea of equally qualified candidates.

#### Process/Insights:

- Having recently graduated from a rigorous bootcamp, I find myself eager to explore a multitude of concepts and technologies. However, I recognize the need to judiciously manage my time and establish clear priorities. This is where the significance of building a compelling portfolio comes into play. My objective is to construct a portfolio that not only sharpens my skills but also stands out in a saturated job market.

- In pursuit of this goal, I discovered *Astro*, a relatively new and innovative framework. What sets *Astro* apart is its UI agnosticism, allowing the incorporation of components from various libraries. Designed primarily for content-focused websites, *Astro* aligns seamlessly with my portfolio vision. Its integrated support for *Markdown* is an enticing feature, offering a fresh and unexplored dimension to my portfolio. However, a challenge I encountered was coming to terms with *Astro*'s default absence of JavaScript. While it can be integrated, doing so requires precise handling through directives. This hurdle was overcome through thorough exploration of the documentation, as with the complexity of *Astro's Content Collections*.
