#### Background/Description

**Context**: In unit 3 of our boot camp, we shifted our focus back to front-end development. This unit marked our introduction to a game-changing library, *React*. The transition from manipulating the *DOM* manually in unit 1 to working with *React*'s abstractions was a significant shift that offered a more efficient and enjoyable development experience.

#### Process/Insights:

- **Understanding React's Internals**: To use React effectively, it was crucial to understand what happens under the hood. React's abstraction is a double-edged sword; it simplifies development, but without a deeper understanding, it can lead to more bugs. To tackle this challenge, I focused on breaking down the flow of data in React. I asked questions like when do certain hooks run, what triggers a render, how does state change affect the application, and are there any side effects? These are the questions I constantly asked myself when developing with React.

- **Project Migration Challenge**: As part of this unit, I was presented with a challenging task: migrating an existing application developed with *Create-React-App* to a custom framework. This project not only tested my *React* knowledge but also pushed me to apply my understanding of *React*'s internals in a real-world scenario. To succeed in this project ( and in future ones ), I recognized the importance of having a strong grasp of the fundamental tools that power most modern web development frameworks. I delved deep into understanding the roles of three crucial tools: *Babel*, for transpiling, *Gulp*, for automating, and *Webpack*, for bundling.

#### Key Takeaways:

- Promoting reusability and maintainability of code with *Component-Driven Development*

- React's internal workings: *components lifecycle*, *state management*, *side effects*.

- Real-world project experience, like *migrating applications* to custom frameworks, tests and reinforces knowledge.

- Proficiency in *Babel*, *Gulp*, *Webpack* makes it easier to adapt when learning new frameworks, as the core principles remain consistent across different technologies.
